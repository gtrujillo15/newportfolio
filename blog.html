                <h3>Tueday, January 28, 2020</h3>
                <p>I've been quite busy with a quite a few projects so I haven't been able to work on coding projects in
                    a bit. But I definitely need to get back into it. I can see my Github becoming less and less green,
                    which makes me sad. Our cohort is taking a bigger focus on WordPress security more and more, but
                    we're looking into developing a dashboard for our future clients so we're going to be using Laravel,
                    which I'm definitely excited about. I've created a Laravel project on the side but haven't made it
                    into a git repository yet. I'm not sure why I haven't but I definitely should. And after work, I've
                    been working on a side hustle or volunteering.<br>
                    Last week I met with a past student that I co-taught because she wanted to ask me questions about
                    WordPress and it was definitely nice that I was able to use what I've learned in the cohort to help
                    others outside.<br>
                    I'm also planning on volunteering for the Women's Conference that's held annually. There's a
                    planning meeting tomorrow and my friend asked me to come. I think it'll be a great opportunity to
                    volunteer. I'm also thinking of taking an evening class but we'll see.<br>
                    I just need to carve out some more time to code. I definitely feel like I haven't done it in a
                    couple of weeks and in a short amount of time, it can make you feel like you've already gotten
                    rusty.<br>
                    I just wanted to write something really quick while I had some time but I will definitely keep
                    posting here!</p>

                <h3>Monday, January 6, 2020</h3>
                <p>It's the start of a new year! I'm hoping 2020 is my year and I'm certainly going to work towards it.
                    My main goal as a junior developer is to gain full-time employment. Ideally, it would be at the
                    company I'm currently an intern at but it depends on if they're hiring. I'd like to work for an
                    exciting company that's always creating something new and that's diverse in their team.<br>
                    But I have to admit that it's quite overwheming trying to learn as much as I can because I feel like
                    there's so much I have yet to learn. I wish I had more time! My lead developer says I pick things up
                    quickly and I definitely have with Laravel but I feel like I need to go faster. <br>
                    I hope anyone who reads this has a great year and that you also meet all your goals.</p>

                <h3>Sunday December 8, 2019</h3>
                <p>We are on the last month of the 2010's! The holidays have arrived. My home is fully decorated and I
                    have completed the majority of my holiday shopping, just so you know. I hope you're having a great
                    holiday so far too. If you were like me last year where I didn't prepare, take the next weekend and
                    set some time to create a short list of those you want to thank and think of some gifts. Chocolate's
                    usually work well!</p>

                <h3>Sunday November 28, 2019</h3>
                <p>This weekend I finally took the time to add a blog portion and add some projects I have been working
                    on. I've also been attending many events and have had the opportunity to participate in some great
                    things so I wanted to add a blog where I could add them here. If you have the time, I also post on
                    Instagram and LinkedIn. Please feel free to follow me on either platforms.<br><br>
                    Tonight, I also worked on the Mad Libs project I added. I originally started it months ago but
                    didn't finish it until today. Surprisingly, after about 10 minutes I understood where I left off and
                    felt a lot more confident in completing it. However, coming back to this project, I now would do it
                    a lot differently than I had done it back then. I finished it in the old way just because it was
                    almost complete. But looking back now, I would turn everything into functions so that individuals
                    could keep getting new sentences and have it randomized. It's my next goal so that I'm able to churn
                    out more sentences quicker and in less code than what I originally wrote. But I think it's still
                    pretty cool going back to old code and realizing there's quicker ways to do things.<br><br>
                    It was a productive weekend. Yesterday, I worked on Plan-Go and completed the homepage and somewhat
                    started on the layout (you'll see a couple of brightly colored red and blue boxes). And then I
                    completed a quick game of Mad Libs. I then added those two projects to my "My Work" section here and
                    updated this site a bit.<br><br>
                    Personally, I'm trying to just trying to do as much as I can everday and learn as much as I can.
                    Sometimes I think I do get overwhelmed because I wish I was at a higher skill level than I am right
                    now but at the same time, I can't rush time. I love putting in the work and learning how to get
                    things to work, I just need to remember to have the patience and enjoy my time as a new developer.
                    I'm currently 1 year and 3 months in so I'm still new but I hope to be a more experienced developer
                    as time goes on.</p>
