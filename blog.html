                <h3>Sunday November 28, 2019</h3>
                <p>This weekend I finally took the time to add a blog portion and add some projects I have been working
                    on. I've also been attending many events and have had the opportunity to participate in some great
                    things so I wanted to add a blog where I could add them here. If you have the time, I also post on Instagram and LinkedIn. Please feel free to follow me on either platforms.<br><br> 
                    Tonight, I also worked on the Mad Libs project I added. I originally started it months ago but didn't finish it until today. Surprisingly, after about 10 minutes I understood where I left off and felt a lot more confident in completing it. However, coming back to this project, I now would do it a lot differently than I had done it back then. I finished it in the old way just because it was almost complete. But looking back now, I would turn everything into functions so that individuals could keep getting new sentences and have it randomized. It's my next goal so that I'm able to churn out more sentences quicker and in less code than what I originally wrote. But I think it's still pretty cool going back to old code and realizing there's quicker ways to do things.<br><br>
                    It was a productive weekend. Yesterday, I worked on Plan-Go and completed the homepage and somewhat started on the layout (you'll see a couple of brightly colored red and blue boxes). And then I completed a quick game of Mad Libs. I then added those two projects to my "My Work" section here and updated this site a bit.<br><br>
                    Personally, I'm trying to just trying to do as much as I can everday and learn as much as I can. Sometimes I think I do get overwhelmed because I wish I was at a higher skill level than I am right now but at the same time, I can't rush time. I love putting in the work and learning how to get things to work, I just need to remember to have the patience and enjoy my time as a new developer. I'm currently 1 year and 3 months in so I'm still new but I hope to be a more experienced developer as time goes on.</p>
